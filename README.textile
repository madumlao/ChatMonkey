= ChatMonkey

== What's ChatMonkey?
Simply put, ChatMonkey is a web-based chatroom services. You sign up and you get to chat
with whoever is in the room.

== Why'd you make another one?
Because I want to. It's part of how I study Rails.

== Why ChatMonkey?
Because I couldn't think of any more names plus this one's available in Heroku.

== What more to add?

* Private rooms and inviting people
* Probably change the 10s poll to probably long polling or something more efficient

If you've got more things in mind, just shoot me an email or put it up as an issue here in Github.
